        <h1>A Beautiful Life Together from “Reflections on Marriage for the Bride and Groom”</h1>
Let love be your shelter,
For at times the world is a noisy and confusing place.
So make a home that is a haven, a peaceful place where you can listen to your hearts and savor the comfortable closeness you share.

No matter how busy your days may be, make time for yourselves.
Hold hands. Unwind. Surprise each other.
Find little chances every day to show you’re grateful to be partners, to be friends, to be married.

Life is not perfect. You will make mistakes.
But each time you meet life’s challenges together,
You will grow wiser, stronger and surer of your love.

Cherish your yesterday.
They are irreplaceable souvenirs of your journey through life.
Make memories that will bring smiles and sighs
Whenever you look back.

Look forward, too. Dream together. Plan together.
Make promises to keep. Believe in your tomorrows,
Because tomorrows are what forever is made of.

To make love last, put each other first
That is the way to make a beautiful life together,
The kind of life you both deserve so very much.
